    <h2>About Apple Pie</h2>
    <p>This is a very simple tasty recepe for apple pie. While some people like theirs with cinnamon or other spices added in, I like mine plain. Apples all the way!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>Crust:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>110g plain flour</li>
      <li>50g cooking margarine</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Filling:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking apples</li>
      <li>Sugar (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>For the crust:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Crumble the margarine into the flour and salt.</li>
      <li>Add a small splash of water, to bind all together.</li>
      <li>Let the pastry rest for half an hour in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the filling:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Peel and chop the apples into a deep pan.</li>
      <li>Add sugar to taste.</li>
      <li>Put the lid on the pan, light the stove and keep the mix at a slow simmer.</li>
      <li>Cook until the apples are falling apart and there is a nice sauce.</li>
      <li>Let the mix cool down before putting the pie together.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Putting it all together:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Roll out almost two thirds of the pastry to the size of the tin.</li>
      <li>Chop off the edges of the pastry, leaving a little space to join the lid.</li>
      <li>Add the apple sauce.</li>
      <li>Roll out the rest of the pastry to make the lid. If you are artistic, make patterns!</li>
      <li>Put the lid over the rest of the pie and crimp the edges of the pastry together.</li>
      <li>If there are no holes in the pastry, cut two small slits in to the top of the pastry, to let the steam out.</li>
      <li>Cook in the oven at a medium temperature, til the pastry is light brown and crunchy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And there you have it! One lovely simple apple pie to share with friends and family.</p>
